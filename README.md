# gear_orientation
Use computer vision to detect the angle of rotation of a gear

The jupyter notebook attached shows a number of approaches and attempts made to solve the challenge. The GearOrientation_IP describes the basic image processing techniques used to solve and the GearOrientation_ml describes the possible approaches if we intend to use machine learning for feature extraction followed by rotation detection. The notebooks are self-explanatory. You can easily rerun them on google colab. As mentioned in the challenge ubuntu 22.04 is in use, I want to emphasize that OS has nothing to do with the codes written as we are simply fetching the stored images. Also the images used for test and template are the first image of each folder.
